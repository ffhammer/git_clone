Since I had some time during my gap year and historically sucked at anything git-related,  
I thought: *why not create a git clone in Go?*  
Thus, **gvc** (Go Version Control) was born.

Having finished it did not help â€” I still feel like I suck at git (:

Also, if you're proficient in Go: for your own safety, please refrain from looking at the code.

I completed [these commands.](command_infos.txt)

Also includes a `.gvcignore` file for ignoring specific files, globs, and folders.
